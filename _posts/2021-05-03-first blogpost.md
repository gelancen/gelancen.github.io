# 1. Introduction|Jekyll - Static Site Generator

 ![Jekyll homepage](https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/008i3skNgy1gqzcrq1ovjj31bu0u0afq.jpg)

Jekyll, as a static site generators, is super popular and really useful if one is trying to build a **blog or a static site**.

If one wanted to create a blog but he or she didn't want to get involved with some heavy and potentially expensive content management system or didn't know enough about HTML and CSS and web development to be able to write  custom pages well, Jekyll can kind of act as like a middleman so one can use a jekyll theme and then can just write one's own blog posts **using markdown**. **Without touching a single line of HTML or CSS or JavaScript**, one can actually have an awesome responsive and really good looking website and blog.

Jekyll also allows people to create their own themes and layouts. One can basically just configure the entire site and control every line of HTML and CSS on a blog or a static site by using Jekyll.
