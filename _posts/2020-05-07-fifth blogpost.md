# 5. Using Markdown to Update Blog Posts

Download [Typora](https://typora.io/) - a markdown editor, markdown reader

Open a new file

(The posts I created for this blog are based on the group project, Pagode-Europeana China assigned from the course Cultural Policy. The original posted were published on the WeChat Official Account, Pagode, while the blog posts were the adapted version. )
